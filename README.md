Example data projects

This repository contains two examples of coding that I've done for data projects. The first is an older R script experiment to upload csv data into a dataframe to make common calculations for our factory processes. The second is a recent Jupyter notebook that uses scikit-learn to develop a basic regression model to predict cost for a factory process.
