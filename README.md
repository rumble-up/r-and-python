Example data projects

This repository contains two examples of coding that I've done for data projects. The [first](https://github.com/stupinster/r-and-python/blob/master/BatchTrack6.R) is an older R script experiment to upload csv data into a dataframe to make common calculations for our factory processes. The [second](https://github.com/stupinster/r-and-python/blob/master/MS80-Cost-Regression-Log.ipynb) is a recent Jupyter notebook that uses scikit-learn to develop a basic regression model to predict cost for a factory process.
